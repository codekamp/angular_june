// code can be divided into two camps:
// 1. Business logic - core of you software that process input to generate output
// 2. Application logic - How to take input from user and show output to user


// Model-View-Controller - MVC

// Model Classes - contains business logic. Have nothing to do with Htm/css. Should
// only take input and based on that give output. Models are reusable.
// Models should not know anything about controller and views


// View Classes - Responsible for taking input from user and giving output to user
// views are highly reusable.
// views should not know anything about controller and model


// Control classes - connect model and views. They know about both views and models


// Component classes falls in both view and controller camps.
// Dumb components are views. Smart components are controller.
// Dumb component is a component which depends only on input for taking in data
// and output of emitting out events.
